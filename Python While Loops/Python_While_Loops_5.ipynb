        "In programming, the loops are the constructs that repeatedly execute a piece of code based on the conditions. These are useful in many situations like going through every element of a list, doing an operation on a range of values, etc.\n",

        "There are two types of loops in Python and these are for and while loops. Both of them work by following the below steps:\n",

        "2. If True, execute the body of the block under it. And update the iterator/ the value on which the condition is checked.\n",
