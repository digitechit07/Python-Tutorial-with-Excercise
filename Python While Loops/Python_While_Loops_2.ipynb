        "# **Common while Mistakes and Tips**\n",
        "Python while loops are very useful for writing robust and efficient programs. However, there are some important points to keep in mind if you want to use them properly.\n",
        "\n",
        "The biggest mistake is to forget about incrementing the loop variable – or not incrementing it correctly. Both may result in infinite loops or loops that do not function as expected. This might need extra attention, especially when working with nested loops.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another tip: Do not overuse the break statement. Keep in mind that it exits the while loop entirely. If you place a break statement with an if condition, the while loop does not execute the remaining part. Recall the examples we have done on the break and continue statements. It’s better to use the continue statement if you want to complete the entire loop."

Looping basically means being able to repeat the execution of a certain portion of code more than once (known as iterations), based on loop parameters. Python offers two main looping constructs that serve different purposes: for and while statements. In this article, let’s focus on the while loop."
