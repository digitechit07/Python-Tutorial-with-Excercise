What Are Comments in Python Used For?
Comments in Python are identified with a hash symbol, #, and extend to the end of the line. Hash characters in a string are not considered comments, however. There are three ways to write a comment - as a separate line, beside the corresponding statement of code, or as a multi-line comment block.

There are multiple uses of writing comments in Python. Some significant uses include:

Increasing readability
Explaining the code to others
Understanding the code easily after a long-term
Including resources
Re-using the existing code

Advantages of Comments in Python
1. Enhanced Readability
Comments help you and others understand the purpose and functionality of your code by clearly stating the reasoning behind it. This is particularly useful for complicated code or stuff you return to after a long break.

2. Code That Documents Itself
Well-written comments make your code almost self-documenting. Comments that provide the logic behind your coding choices become important resources for future readers who may need to comprehend or alter the code.

3. Improved Cooperation
In team projects, effective communication is essential for efficient teamwork. They enable other developers to incorporate their contributions easily and rapidly understand the operation of the code.

4. Improved troubleshooting
By describing the anticipated behavior of different code blocks, comments can serve as useful cues for troubleshooting. This can help to speed up the process of identifying and resolving program faults.

5. Code Control
Comments let you turn off certain code segments for targeted debugging. This enables you to debug individual software components without interfering with the remainder of the code's execution.

6. Logic Explanation
If there are complex algorithms or logic buried in the code, comments can explain them. Understanding the reasoning behind intricate computations or decision-making processes can be greatly aided by this.

7. Code Maintainability
Comments facilitate code maintenance and modification, particularly after prolonged usage. Developers can more confidently and effectively make the necessary modifications to the code by understanding the code's purpose through comments.

8. Code Reuse
Reusability in other program sections is encouraged by well-written comments that describe a code section's usefulness. This can leverage well-commented existing code, saving time and effort.

9. Knowledge Sharing
You can impart your coding expertise to colleagues or aspiring developers by using comments as a forum. You can aid in the development of a shared understanding of the codebase by explaining your reasoning and coding decisions.

10. Learning Aid
Even for yourself, comments can be a very beneficial learning aid. You can learn more about your coding style and process from when you wrote your code by going back and adding comments.

What Are the Different Types of Comments in Python?
There are three types of comments: single-line, multi-line, and docstring comments. The syntax of comments varies depending on the type. This tutorial will explore every kind of comment individually, along with examples.

1. Single-Line Comments
Single-line comments begin with the “#” character. Anything that is written in a single line after ‘#’ is considered as a comment. The syntax for writing single-line comments is:

# comments here

There are two ways of using single-line comments in Python. You can use it before the code or next to the code. The example depicted below shows the use of comments in both ways.

Single-LineComments

PEP8, Python Style Guide, recommends using less than 79 characters in a single-line comment to make it easier to read. If your comment is exceeding the recommended length, you can use the next type: multi-line comments.

2. Multi-Line Comments
Python does not support multi-line comments. However, there are multiple ways to overcome this issue. None of these ways are technically multi-line comments, but you can use them as one. The first way is by using # at the beginning of each line of the comment.

Multi-LineComments

The next way is by using string literals but not assigning them to any variables. If you do not assign a string literal to a variable, the Python interpreter ignores it. Use this to your advantage to write multi-line comments. You can either use a single (‘’) quotation or double (“”) quotation.

Multi-LineComments2

You can also use multi-line strings for commenting. To do this, use either a ‘’ or “” quotation marks three times.

3. Python Docstrings
Python provides an in-built feature called docstrings for commenting on modules, methods, functions, objects, and classes. They are written in the first line after defining a module, function, method, etc., using three quotation marks (‘’ or “”). If you do not use it in the first line, the interpreter will not take it as a docstring. You can also access docstrings using the __doc__ attribute.

4. String Literals
Python code can be made more understandable and explained by using comments. String literals, multi-line comments, and single-line comments are the three main comments categories. Single-line comments, which are intended for succinct explanations, begin with the '#' symbol and go until the end of the line. Triple quotes (''''' or '"""') can be used to generate multi-line comments, which enable the commenting out of many lines and are appropriate for more in-depth explanations. Furthermore, string literals can be utilized as comments in classes or functions, especially regarding documentation. These unassigned string objects act as explanation notes in the code, even though they aren't comments.
# This is a single-line comment

"""
This is a multi-line comment.
It spans multiple lines.
"""

def example_function():
    """This is a docstring, a type of string literal used for documentation."""
    pass

'''
Another example of a multi-line comment
using single quotes.
'''
The ‘#’ symbol is used for a single-line comment.
Triple quotes ‘"""’ or ‘'''’ are used for multi-line comments.
The string literal ‘"""This is a docstring..."""’ inside the function ‘example_function()’ serves as a documentation string (docstring), which is a special type of string literal used for providing information about the function.

How to Write Good Comments in Python?
Comments are a crucial part of a program. Hence, it is essential to learn how to write good comments. Here are some characteristics that define good comments.

Ensure that they are concise
Don’t write generic comments; only have them if they add information
(a=10 #assigning 10 to a, avoid writing such generic comments)

Write comments that describe the overall task of a function or method and not specific details
Good comments are self-explanatory
Don’t write redundant comments
