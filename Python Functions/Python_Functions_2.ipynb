These descriptions serve as documentation for your function so that anyone who reads your function’s docstring understands what your function does, without having to trace through all the code in the function definition.\n",
        "\n",
        "Function docstrings are placed in the immediate line after the function header and are placed in between triple quotation marks. An appropriate Docstring for your hello() function is ‘Prints “Hello World”’."
