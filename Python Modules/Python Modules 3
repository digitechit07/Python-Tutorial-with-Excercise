Understanding Python Built-In Modules
Python built-in modules are pre-existing libraries or collections of functions and classes that are an integral part of the Python programming language. These modules are included in Python's standard library, which means they are available by default when you install Python, and you don't need to install them separately. If you need to Install Python on Ubuntu, you can do so easily, and these modules will be included without requiring separate installation.

Python's built-in modules provide a wide range of functionalities, from handling mathematics, working with data structures, and interacting with the operating system to supporting network protocols, performing file I/O, and much more. These modules are designed to simplify and expedite various programming tasks, making Python a versatile and powerful language for a broad spectrum of applications. A key feature that enhances Python’s functionality is the Yield in Python keyword, which enables efficient memory usage by allowing functions to return data one piece at a time, especially useful in tasks like handling large data sets or iterative processes.

In essence, these modules, including those that support Python Array, are a set of tools and utilities that help programmers perform common and complex tasks efficiently without having to write everything from scratch, promoting code reusability and reducing development time.
