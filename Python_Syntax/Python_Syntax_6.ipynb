Designed by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python’s design philosophy centers around code readability and the use of significant whitespace. This focus makes Python an ideal language for beginners, yet powerful enough for complex applications in web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more."
