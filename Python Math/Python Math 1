Real-World Example
Imagine you’re working on a physics simulation and need to calculate the trajectory of a projectile. The math module can help compute the necessary trigonometric values to determine its path:

>>> import math
>>> velocity = 20  # m/s
>>> angle = 45  # degrees
>>> angle_rad = math.radians(angle)
>>> horizontal_velocity = velocity * math.cos(angle_rad)
>>> vertical_velocity = velocity * math.sin(angle_rad)
>>> horizontal_velocity
14.142135623730951
>>> vertical_velocity
14.14213562373095
In this example, the math module is used to convert degrees to radians and compute the horizontal and vertical components of the velocity, demonstrating its utility in physics calculations.
