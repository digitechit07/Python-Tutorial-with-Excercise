Introduction
Arrays are powerful tools that allow you to store multiple values in a single variable, making your code more organized and efficient. In this guide, we'll explore the basics of Python arrays, from creating them to performing various operations. We will solve a lot of practice problems along the way.

Creating Arrays in Python
In Python, we use the term "list" instead of "array," but they serve the same purpose. Creating a list is simple - just use square brackets [] and separate the items with commas.

Here's an example:

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "grape"]
numbers = [20, 10, 0, -5]
In this example, fruits is a list of strings, and numbers is a list of integers. Python lists are versatile and can hold different types of data, even other lists!

Coding Task
Let's practice creating a list:

# Create a list of the first 5 positive integers
integers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print("Done")
This task creates a list called integers with the first five positive whole numbers. After creating the list, it prints "Done" to show the task is complete.

Accessing Array Elements
To access elements in a list, we use index numbers. In Python, indexing starts at 0, so the first element is at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on.

Here's how it works:

colors = ["red", "green", "blue"]
# Indexes:   0      1       2

print(colors[0])  # Output: red
print(colors[2])  # Output: blue
You can also use negative indexing to access elements from the end of the list. For example, -1 refers to the last element, -2 to the second-to-last, and so on.

print(colors[-1])  # Output: blue
print(colors[-2])  # Output: green
Coding Task
Let's practice accessing list elements:

months = ["Jan", "Feb", "Apr", "May", "Jun"]
# Output the 3rd element (remember, indexing starts at 0)
print(months[2])

Modifying Array Elements
Python lists are mutable, which means you can change their elements after creating them. To modify an element, simply assign a new value to a specific index.

Example:

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "grape"]
fruits[1] = "kiwi"
print(fruits)  # Output: ["apple", "kiwi", "orange", "grape"]
Coding Task
Let's update an element in a list:

months = ["Jan", "Feb", "Dec", "Apr", "May"]
# Update the 3rd month (index 2) to "Mar"
months[2] = "Mar"
print(months)

Array Operations
Now that we know how to create and access lists, let's look at some common operations we can perform on them.

Finding the length
We use the len() function to find the length of an array.

Example:

pets = ['cat', 'dog', 'mouse']
print(len(pets)) # Output: 3
This code will print 3, the length of the array pets.

Adding Elements
To add elements to a list, you can use two main methods:

append(): Adds an element to the end of the list.
insert(): Adds an element at a specific position in the list.
Examples:

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
fruits.append("orange")
print(fruits)  # Output: ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange"]

fruits.insert(1, "kiwi")
print(fruits)  # Output: ["apple", "kiwi", "banana", "cherry", "orange"]
Coding Task
Let's practice adding elements to a list:

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# Take a number as input and add it to the end of the list
new_number = _____
numbers._____(new_number)
print(numbers)

Removing Elements
To remove elements from a list, you can use these methods:

remove(): Removes the first occurrence of a specified item.
pop(): Removes and returns an item at a specified index (or the last item if no index is specified).
Examples:

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "banana"]
fruits.remove("banana")
print(fruits)  # Output: ["apple", "cherry", "banana"]

removed_fruit = fruits.pop(1)
print(removed_fruit)  # Output: cherry
print(fruits)  # Output: ["apple", "banana"]
Coding Task
Let's practice removing elements from a list. Take an index as input and remove the item at that index.

colors = ['black', 'blue', 'white', 'cyan', 'yellow', 'green']
index = _____
colors.___(index)
print(colors)

Combining Arrays
You can combine two lists using the + operator. This is called list concatenation.

Example:

list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [4, 5, 6]
combined_list = list1 + list2
print(combined_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Coding Task
Let's practice combining lists. Combine list2 and list1 in that order.

list1 = ['Hero', 'Maybe Man', 'Run', 'Enemy']
list2 = ['Annihilate', 'Die for you', 'Am I dreaming', 'Burn the house down']
combined_list = _____
print(combined_list)

User Input for Arrays
Sometimes, you might want to create a list based on user input. Here's how you can do that:

For strings:
fruits = input().split()
print(fruits)
For integers:
numbers = list(map(int, input().split()))
print(numbers)
In both cases, the user should enter items separated by spaces.

Coding Task
Let's practice creating a list from user input. Read a list of integers and print it in reverse order.


You've just learned the basics of working with arrays (lists) in Python. We've covered creating lists, accessing and modifying elements, adding and removing items, combining lists, and even taking user input to create lists.

Remember, practice is key to mastering these concepts. Try creating your own lists and experimenting with different operations. As you become more comfortable with these basics, you'll be able to use lists to solve more complex problems and write more efficient code.
