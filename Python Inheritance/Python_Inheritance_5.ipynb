        "Inheritance allows you to define a new class that has access to the methods and attributes of another class that has already been defined. The class that has the methods and attributes that will be inherited by another class is called the parent class. Other names for the parent class that you may come across are base class and superclass. The class that has access to the attributes and methods of the parent class is called the child class. The child class is also called the subclass. In addition to defining a class that inherits from an existing class, you can define a child class that inherits from multiple parent classes.\n",

        "Inheritance is very powerful as it allows the developer to limit code duplication. By designing a hierarchy of classes, you can prevent duplicate lines of codes that perform the same task. This not only makes code easy to read, but it also significantly improves maintainability. For example, if you have many places in your code where you are calculating the error rate of model predictions, you can refactor that into a parent class method that is inherited by child classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "When hierarchical class design (inheritance) is done well, it also makes testing and debugging easier. This is because well-defined tasks will be localized to a single place in the code base, so when a change needs to be made to how a task is completed, finding the necessary code that needs to be changed should be straightforward. Further, once a change is made to a method in the parent class, the change is propagated to all of the irrespective child classes."
